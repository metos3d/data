1. added read/write routines for PETSc vector/matrix
2. split computation of coarse time steps for matrices into two routines (explicit/implicit)
3. got rid of start/end indices files
4. added profiles/rvolumes files, all files have PETSc format now
4.1 profiles file is a sparse PETSc matrix now
4.2 volumes are relative, i.e. sum(rvolumes) == 1
5. added TODO.txt file
