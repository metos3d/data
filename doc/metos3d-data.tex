\section{Introdution}

Metos3D was developed to use data provided by the
\href{http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~spk/Research/TMM/tmm.html}{Transport Matrix Method}
in the first place \citep[cf. ][]{KhViCa05}.
%
This original data is maintained by
\href{http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~spk/}{Samar Khatiwala}.
%
Metos3D provides already prepared data for usage.

\section{Data}

Currently a $ 2.8125^\circ $ ($ 2.8^\circ $ for short) spatial resolution is provided.
The vector length, the profile count and the maximum number of layers is $ 52749 $, $ 4448 $
and $ 15 $, respectively. The temporal resolution is $ 3 $ hours,
assuming $ 360 $ days and $ 2880 $ steps per year.

%	Data Hierarchy
%
\subsection{Data Hierarchy}

The data is organized in a hierarchy of directories starting with the
root directory named \texttt{TMM}.
The \textbf{main distinction} between data files is the \textbf{spatial resolution}:
\begin{verbatim}
.../TMM/
    2.8/
\end{verbatim}

For a spatial resolution you will find a distinction
into \textbf{geometry}, \textbf{initialization}, \textbf{forcing} and
\textbf{transport} within that directory:
\begin{verbatim}
.../TMM/2.8/
    Geometry/
    Initialization/
    Forcing/
    Transport/
\end{verbatim}

The geometry and initialization directories have no further subdirectories.
The forcing is divided into \textbf{boundary} and \textbf{domain conditions}.
\begin{verbatim}
.../TMM/2.8/Forcing/
    BoundaryCondition/
    DomainCondition/
\end{verbatim}

The transport matrices are organized within the transport directory.
The first level of subdirectories denote the \textbf{kind} of matrices (see \cite{KhViCa05}).
The second distinguishes between \textbf{temporal resolutions}.
\begin{verbatim}
.../TMM/2.8/Transport/
    Matrix5_4/
        1dt/
\end{verbatim}
